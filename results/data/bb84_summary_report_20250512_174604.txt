BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Analysis Report
==========================================================

Analysis ID: 20250512_174604
Date: 2025-05-12 17:50:42
Parameters:
- Key length: 1000 bits
- Trials per scenario: 20

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

1. Eavesdropping Detection Performance:
   - Without eavesdropping: QBER = 0.0000 ± 0.0000
   - With eavesdropping: QBER = 0.2600 ± 0.0657
   - Security threshold exceeded: YES
   - Average QBER increase: 0.2600

2. Key Generation Performance:
   - Average key rate (no eavesdropping): 0.506
   - Average key rate (with eavesdropping): 0.492
   - Sifted key length: ~506 bits (50.6% of transmitted)

3. Security Assessment:
   - Keys secure without eavesdropping: 100.0%
   - Keys secure with eavesdropping: 0.0%

DETAILED ANALYSIS
=================

1. Protocol Validation:
   - The BB84 implementation successfully demonstrates quantum key distribution
   - Intercept-resend attacks are reliably detected through QBER monitoring
   - The ~50% sifting rate matches theoretical predictions
   - Clear distinction between secure and insecure scenarios

2. Eavesdropping Impact:
   - Intercept-resend attacks introduce ~25% QBER, well above the 11% threshold
   - The attack detection rate is 100% when QBER > 0.11
   - Key generation rate remains unaffected by eavesdropping
   - Security is compromised but detectable

3. Performance Metrics:
   - Mean QBER without eavesdropping: 0.000000
   - Mean QBER with eavesdropping: 0.260000
   - Standard deviation (no eavesdropping): 0.000000
   - Standard deviation (with eavesdropping): 0.065727

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. Implement error correction mechanisms to reduce QBER below security threshold
2. Add privacy amplification to ensure security even with partial information leakage
3. Consider implementing device-independent protocols for enhanced security
4. Investigate performance with different attack strategies beyond intercept-resend

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

- Simulation uses AerSimulator for quantum circuit execution
- Random number generation uses Python's random module with default seeding
- Error bars represent standard deviation across trials
- Statistical significance tested with both parametric and non-parametric methods

CONCLUSION
==========

The BB84 protocol simulation successfully demonstrates:
1. Effective quantum key distribution in ideal conditions
2. Reliable eavesdropping detection through QBER monitoring
3. Clear security thresholds that distinguish safe from compromised scenarios
4. Consistent performance across multiple trials

Next steps should focus on implementing error correction and privacy amplification
to create a complete, practical QKD system.
